---
# Description
crewAI is a platform designed to simplify the creation and management of multi-agent AI systems. It offers an easy-to-use framework that allows users to automate important workflows quickly and effectively. With over 1,400,000 multi-agent crews running in the last seven days, crewAI has demonstrated its robustness and efficiency in handling real-world use cases.

## Concepts
crewAI is built on the concept of multi-agent systems, where multiple AI agents work together to achieve complex tasks. The platform emphasizes power with simplicity, making it accessible for both novice and experienced developers. Users can bring their favorite AI models from providers like OpenAI, Google, and HuggingFace, fine-tune them, and deploy them using pre-built templates. The platform ensures privacy and security by running each crew in isolated VPCs.

## Usages
crewAI can be used for a variety of applications, from automating business processes to creating intelligent chatbots. The platform supports production-ready multi-agent automations, offering features like webhooks, gRPC, and metrics. Users can turn their multi-agent crews into APIs and get enterprise support through crewAI+. Additionally, the community aspect allows developers to share their agents and models, and receive help from other users.
