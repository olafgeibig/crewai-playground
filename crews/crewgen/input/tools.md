## Available crewAI Tools[¶](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Tools/#available-crewai-tools "Permanent link")

- **Error Handling**: All tools are built with error handling capabilities, allowing agents to gracefully manage exceptions and continue their tasks.
- **Caching Mechanism**: All tools support caching, enabling agents to efficiently reuse previously obtained results, reducing the load on external resources and speeding up the execution time. You can also define finer control over the caching mechanism using the `cache_function` attribute on the tool.

Here is a list of the available tools and their descriptions:
