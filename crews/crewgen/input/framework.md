# Crew Design
Approach the design of a multi-agent system as if you were a manager responsible for assembling a team to achieve a specific goal. The process involves several key steps:

1.	**Define the Goal**: Clearly identify the primary objective that the multi-agent system needs to accomplish. This goal serves as the foundation for everything else.
2.	**Outline the Process**: Determine the process that the agents should follow to achieve the goal. This includes the steps, methodologies, and workflows that will guide the agents’ actions.
3.	**Select the Agents**: Think about the type of people you would hire if this were a real-world team. What skills, expertise, and roles are necessary to achieve the goal effectively? For each role, specify the qualifications and experience needed.
4.	**Assign Roles**: Based on the roles you’ve identified, define the agents’ roles within the system. Consider their backstories, specific goals, and how their individual responsibilities contribute to the overall objective.
5.	**Specialization Over Generalization**: Instead of generic roles, opt for specialized agents tailored to the specific needs of the project. For instance, rather than a generic “researcher,” consider an “HR specialist” if the task is related to human resources, or a “senior copywriter” instead of just a “writer.”
