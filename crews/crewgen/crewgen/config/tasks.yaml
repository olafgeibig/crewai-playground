crew_concept:
  name: Create a Concept for a Crew of Agents
  description: >
    Define the agent crew concept for the given purpose, allowing the agent creation crew to design
    and create a crew of agents and their tasks. Crew purpose:
    "{crew_purpose}"

    Objective:
    Design a multi-agent system (crew) as if you were a manager assembling a team to achieve a specific goal. 
    This involves defining the system's objective, outlining the process, selecting and assigning roles to agents, 
    and ensuring each role is specialized to meet the project's needs effectively.

    Steps to Complete the Task:
      1.	Define the Goal:
        - Identify the primary objective: Clearly articulate the main goal that the multi-agent system (crew) 
          is intended to accomplish. This could range from solving a specific problem to achieving a particular 
          outcome within a set timeframe.
        - Establish success criteria: Determine how success will be measured. What metrics or indicators 
          will demonstrate that the goal has been achieved?
      2.	Outline the Process:
        - Determine the workflow: Break down the process into clear steps or stages that agents need 
          to follow to achieve the goal. Consider the sequence of actions, dependencies, and critical paths.
        - Select methodologies and tools: Identify any specific methodologies, frameworks, or tools that 
          will guide the agents' actions throughout the process. Ensure these align with the goal.
      3.	Select the Agents:
        - Identify necessary skills and expertise: Consider the types of agents needed if this were a real-world team. 
          Determine the key skills, expertise, and knowledge required to achieve the goal effectively.
        - Define agent roles: For each required skill or area of expertise, specify the corresponding agent role. 
          Outline the qualifications and experience necessary for each role.
      4.	Assign Roles:
        - Role assignment: Assign specific roles to the agents within the system based on the identified roles. 
          Ensure that each agent has a clear, defined role that contributes to the overall objective.
        - Detail responsibilities: For each role, specify the individual responsibilities and tasks that the agent will undertake. 
          Consider how these tasks will support the system's goal.
      5.	Specialization Over Generalization:
        - Tailor roles to the project needs: Instead of assigning generic roles, create specialized agents that are 
          tailored to the specific needs of the project. For example, if the task involves analyzing market data, 
          assign a "Market Analyst" rather than a generic "Researcher."
        - Leverage expertise: Ensure that each agent's role is designed to maximize their specific expertise, 
          making them highly effective in their designated tasks.
      6.	Include Quality Assurance:
        - Always add reviews by a quality assurance agent to the process workflow. This might not always be needed, 
          but can be beneficial if the task is complex or if the result must meet high-quality standards.
      7.	Consider Human Involvement:
        - Evaluate whether human involvement is beneficial for the process workflow. This is advisable when the goal 
          involves tasks that require human interaction, judgment, or approval. For instance, consider human input 
          for final approvals or when a specific tone or style is required.

    Objective:
    Craft detailed goals and backstories for each agent, ensuring that each narrative aligns with the overall crew purpose 
    and fosters a cohesive, high-performance crew dynamic. The backstories should provide rich context that motivates the agents' 
    roles and goals, enhancing their interaction and collaboration. 
    IMPORTANT: Always include an agent for quality assurance to review the crew's results.
    Write the agent definitions in a YAML file in the crewAI format, like the examples in ./input/config/agents.yaml.

    Steps to Complete the Task:
      1. Review Crew Concept and Roles:
        - Begin by thoroughly reviewing the crew concept and the roles defined by the Crew Designer.
        - Understand the overarching crew purpose, goal, and how each role contributes to the crew's success.
      2. Define Individual Goals:
        - For each agent, create a specific, measurable, and aligned goal that guides their decision-making process.
        - Ensure that each goal contributes directly to the crew's overall objectives and enhances the agent's role within the crew.
      3. Develop Interconnected Backstories:
        - Create detailed backstories for each agent that explain their motivation, experience, and how they fit into the crew.
        - Ensure that the backstories are interconnected, reflecting a shared history or set of experiences that strengthen the crew's cohesion.
        - Incorporate elements that demonstrate why these particular agents work well together, fostering a sense of unity and collaboration.
      4. Foster a High-Performance Crew Dynamic:
        - Design the backstories to highlight the agents' complementary skills and personalities, illustrating how they support and elevate each other's performance.
        - Include narrative elements that explain how each agent's background prepares them for their role and contributes to the team’s success.
      5.  Parameterize Descriptions:
        - If an agent needs more focus, add a placeholder variable in curly braces to parametrize the agent description with user input.
      6.  Follow Quality Assurance and Human Input Guidelines:
        - Adhere to the crew concept's process regarding quality assurance and human input.
      7.  Study Example Files:
        - Review the examples file at ./input/config/agents.yaml to ensure consistency and accuracy in the format.
        - Use default_llm as the llm.

  expected_output: >

task_definition:
  name: Generate Task Definitions Based on Crew Concept and Agent Roles
  description: >
    Objective:
    The Task Designer is responsible for analyzing the crew concept and breaking it down into agent-specific tasks that 
    align with the roles and responsibilities. The Task Designer will ensure that each task supports 
    the intended process and workflow as envisioned by the crew concept. Tasks should be focused and avoid too many steps.
    IMPORTANT: It's better to have multiple focused tasks with a clear objective and output for an agent than one big task.
    Write the task definitions in a YAML file in the crewAI format, like the examples in ./input/config/tasks.yaml.

    Steps to Complete the Task:
      1.	Study the Crew Concept and Agent Definitions:
        - Understand the structure of the crew, the roles assigned to each agent, and the process workflow.
        - Ensure a clear understanding of how the crew is expected to function as a cohesive unit.
        - Understand the crew's objectives and purpose.
      2.	Thoroughly Analyze the Crew Process Workflow Step by Step:
        - Assess the complexity of each process step.
        - Identify needed skills for each step, such as 'search the internet,' 'execute code,' 'read a website,' etc. This will be used for tool assignment.
        - Consider the data sources or data types that an agent might need to interact with during each process step.
      3.	Break Down the Crew Concept Process Workflow into Tasks:
        - Decide how many focused tasks each process step should be divided into, depending on its complexity. Simpler steps may require only one task.
        - Ensure that each task is clearly defined, with specific objectives that contribute to the overall crew goal.
        - Add hints for required skills and tools to the task description.
        - Structure tasks to follow the intended sequence and workflow as proposed by the Crew Designer.
      4.	Draft Task Definitions:
        - Write detailed task definitions for each agent, specifying the objectives, steps to complete, and deliverables for each task.
        - Ensure that tasks are interconnected where necessary, reflecting the communication patterns defined in the crew concept.
        - If the concept recommended human input for a process step, add this to the task description. For instance, in the first task of a process step if it involves a question to the user, and in the last task if it requires approval. Ensure human input aligns with the task's objective.
      6.  Ensure Proper YAML References:
          Make sure that the YAML files properly reference:
          - Agents to `default_llm`.
          - Tasks to the correct agents using `agent: agent_name`.
          - Tasks to other tasks as context from previous tasks that are needed as inputs a each task. Make sure to use the appropriate YAML identifiers as values.
      5.	Organize Tasks in a YAML File:
        - Compile all task definitions into a structured YAML file, ensuring that the tasks are well-organized and follow a logical sequence.
        - Validate the YAML syntax to ensure that the file is correctly formatted and ready for use by the agents.
        - Study the the example in ./input/config/tasks.yaml
